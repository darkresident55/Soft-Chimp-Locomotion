# This project is a Part of Many Movement systems i use in my main games, if you'd like to support me, feel free to do so here: https://bmc.link/anemunt

## -- About --
Soft Chimp Locomotion (SCL) is a customizable locomotion system used in games like *Chimps Life*, *Recharge*, and more.
It was created by **Anemunt** and **Terminal**, with rights belonging to both.

## -- Movement Properties --
*SCL includes a flexible movement system that can be tuned through the **Motion Settings** script, located under the **Chimp** object inside the prefab.*

* **Motion Settings** now includes a **Movement Settings Profile system**,
  this lets you create and swap between different physics settings, for example: realistic, arcade-style, or experimental.
* All core locomotion values are controlled here, no need to directly edit the hand objects anymore.

## --Setup --
### Getting started with SCL is simple:
1. Go to the **Soft Chimp Locomotion** folder.
2. Drag the **SCL V10** (or newer) prefab into your Unity scene.
3. By default, it will load with 3 different **Movement Settings Profiles**, so your player can move right away.
   [By Default, it is set to In-Between.]
5. To customize, open the **Motion Settings** script under **Chimp** and either adjust the current profile or create a new one.
